 Need to do next
  - 'visited' state not working in css
  - add H1 or explainer to results page
  - add nav to profile page (not in skeleton framework) - done but could probably look nicer...(now changed to back button which not very semantic)
  - logic to show sport icon on profile page e.g. if netball true show netball
