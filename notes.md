  ## 18.03.17

 Need to do next
  - 'visited' state not working in css 
  - add H1 or explainer to results page - should say specific sport name 
  - logic to show sport icon on profile page e.g. if netball true show netball
  - hover state on homepage link
  - tidy up file structure


  To make actually usable as a prototype:
   -  need to consider both users - the players also. Have two way sign up
   -  need way to submit data - use pusher html?
   - needs to actually explain the proposition and what it does
