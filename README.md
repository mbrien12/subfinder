# Subfinder

This is a project app from a HTML, CSS and Javascript course at Ravensbourne College. Working to develop further as a functional prototype.

## Who's it for?
1. Sports teams who need a last minute player for their game.
2. Individuals who want to play sport every so often, but don't want to commit to a team.

## What problem is it solving?

####For teams 
 - it can often be disappointing to turn up to a game without a full team. Subfinder means that teams don't need to be a man or woman down for the big game.

#### For individuals
 - people new to the city can find it hard to join sports teams
 - some people don't want to or are not able to play every week with the same team
 - it can be daunting to get into a new sport if just a beginner, this is a nice way to try something new
